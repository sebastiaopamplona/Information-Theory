one morning when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin he lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections the bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment his many legs pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he looked whats happened to me  he thought it wasnt a dream his room a proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully between its four familiar walls a collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table  samsa was a travelling salesman  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame it showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel quite sad how about if i sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his present state couldnt get into that position however hard he threw himself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was he must have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that he wouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped when he began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt before oh god he thought what a strenuous career it is that ive chosen travelling day in and day out doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home and on top of that theres the curse of travelling worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them it can all go to hell  he felt a slight itch up on his belly  pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better  found where the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didnt know what to make of  and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder he slid back into his former position getting up early all the time he thought it makes you stupid youve got to get enough sleep other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury for instance whenever i go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts i ought to just try that with my boss  id get kicked out on the spot but who knows maybe that would be the best thing for me if i didnt have my parents to think about id have given in my notice a long time ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell him everything i would let him know just what i feel hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing well theres still some hope  once ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five or six years i suppose  thats definitely what ill do thats when ill make the big change first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five  and he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest of drawers god in heaven  he thought it was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than half past more like quarter to seven had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been  it certainly must have rung yes but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise true he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply because of that what should he do now the next train went at seven  if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about gregors not being there a long time ago the office assistant was the bosss man spineless and with no understanding what about if he reported sick but that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service gregor had never once yet been ill his boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy and whats more would he have been entirely wrong in this case gregor did in fact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual one morning when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin he lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections the bedding was

worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them it can all go to hell  he felt a slight itch up on his belly  pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better  found where the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didnt know what to make of  and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder he slid back into his former position getting up early all the time he thought it makes you stupid youve got to get enough sleep other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury for instance whenever i go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts i ought to just try that with my boss  id get kicked out on the spot but who knows maybe that would be the best thing for me if i didnt have my parents to think about id have given in my notice a long time ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell him everything i would let him know just what i feel hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your subordinates from up there especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing well theres still some hope  once ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five or six years i suppose  thats definitely what ill do thats when ill make the big change first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five  and he looked over at the alarm

alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been  it certainly must have rung yes but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise true he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply because of that what should he do now the next train went at seven  if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about gregors not being there a long time ago the office assistant was the bosss man spineless and with no understanding what about if he reported sick but that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service gregor had never once yet been ill his boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy and whats more would he have been entirely wrong in this case gregor did in fact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual one morning when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin he lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections the bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment his many legs pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he looked whats happened to me  he thought it wasnt a dream his room a proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully between its four familiar walls a collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table  samsa was a travelling salesman  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame it showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel quite sad how about if i sleep a little bit longer

of hearing well theres still some hope  once ive got the money together to pay off my parents debt to him  another five or six years i suppose  thats definitely what ill do thats when ill make the big change first of all though ive got to get up my train leaves at five  and he looked over at the alarm clock ticking on the chest of drawers god in heaven  he thought it was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards it was even later than half past more like quarter to seven had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been  it certainly must have rung yes but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise true he had not slept peacefully but probably all the more deeply because of that what should he do now the next train went at seven  if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about gregors not being there a long time ago the office assistant was the bosss man spineless and with no understanding what about if he reported sick but that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service gregor had never once yet been ill his boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company accuse his parents of having a lazy son and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy and whats more would he have been entirely wrong in this case gregor did in fact apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual one morning when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin he lay on his armourlike back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections the bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment his many legs pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him waved about helplessly as he looked whats happened to me  he thought it wasnt a dream his room a proper human room although a little too small lay peacefully between its four familiar walls a collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table  samsa was a travelling salesman  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice gilded frame it showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane which made him feel quite sad how about if i sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense he thought but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right and in his present state couldnt get into that position however hard he threw himself onto his right he always rolled back to where he was he must have tried it a hundred times shut his eyes so that he wouldnt have to look at the floundering legs and only stopped when he began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt before oh god he thought what a strenuous career it is that ive chosen travelling day in and day out doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home and on top of that theres the curse of travelling worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them it can all go to hell  he felt a slight itch up on his belly  pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better  found where the itch was and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didnt know what to make of  and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder he slid back into his former position getting up early all the time he thought it makes you stupid youve got to get enough sleep other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury for instance whenever i go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts i ought to just try that with my boss  id get kicked out on the spot but who knows maybe that would be the best thing for me if i didnt have my parents to think about id have given in my notice a long time ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell him everything i would let him know just what i feel hed fall right off his desk and its a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk talking down at your
